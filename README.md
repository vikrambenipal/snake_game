# snake_game
The game Snake with a few modifications inspired by the video game Metal Gear Solid. 
Collect as many of the grenades as you can without crashing into any walls or yourself!
Watch out for spotlights (indicated by the yellow tile). If you get caught in them too many times, it can be deadly!
To respawn the location of a grenade, press the N key.
